# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server / Docker image generation with maven (spotify plugin)

## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  
The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

To generate create the container:

First: generate the package
mvn clean package

Second: generate the docker image
mvn package docker:build -DpushImage

Third: run the container 
docker run -p 8080:8080 -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/
